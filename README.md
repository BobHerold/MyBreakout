   Breakout was a video game released by Atari in 1976. For further info about it's history, use this link; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)
   I have used the code for this project directly from a tutorial from the Mozilla Developer's Network; https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript
