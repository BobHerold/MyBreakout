   Breakout was a video game released by Atari in 1976. For further info about it's history, use this link; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)
   I have used the code for this project directly from a tutorial from the Mozilla Developer's Network; https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript
   It is based entirely on JavaScript and rendered on the HTML5 canvas element.

   I chose this game for my milestone project 2 for the Full Stack Developer course from the Code Institute; https://codeinstitute.net/
   This is a simple game that uses a lot of javascript functionality in it's creation and execution.  I tried to build it as responsive as possible, however I regret that 
   I was unable to get touch controls for touch screen devices working for this implementation.
