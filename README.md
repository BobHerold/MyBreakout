   Breakout was a video game released by Atari in 1976. For further info about it's history, use this link; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)
   I have used the code for this project directly from a tutorial from the Mozilla Developer's Network; https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript
   It is based entirely on JavaScript and rendered on the HTML5 canvas element.

   I chose this game for my milestone project 2 for the Full Stack Developer course from the Code Institute:https://codeinstitute.net/
   This is a simple game that uses a lot of javascript functionality in it's creation and execution.  I tried to build it as responsive as possible, however I regret that 
   I was unable to get touch controls for touch screen devices working for this implementation.

<h2>Testing</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
          <p>http://ami.responsivedesign.is/  has been used to see how the game scales on different size screens on Apple devices.  It looks pretty good on all screen sizes, however I was unable to get touch working for touch screen devices, to control the racket. I also checked it on my iPhone 11.</p>
